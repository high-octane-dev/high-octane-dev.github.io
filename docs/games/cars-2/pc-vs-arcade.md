# Cars 2: The Video Game (PC) vs Cars 2: Arcade

## What is Cars 2: The Video Game (PC)?
Cars 2: The Video Game (PC), internally known as the `Win32_Wii` target, refers to the official Windows versions of the game available on Steam and CDs. It's a stripped-down port of the Wii version that simultaneously introduces various post-processing effects and settings menus to improve the overall user experience. However, Win32_Wii is widely considered to be a botched port due to its inability to replicate original lighting and material properties in the Wii version.

## What is Cars 2: Arcade?
Cars 2: Arcade, on the other hand, is a development build of the HD version of Cars 2: The Video Game, internally known as the `Win32` target, that was heavily modified by *Raw Thrills* for use in arcade machines. *Raw Thrills* aimed to simplify the game down into a generic kart racer fit for arcade venues like Chuck E. Cheese, and as such removed numerous gameplay features to accomodate the cabinet's limited control scheme. Only traditional races are functional, and all other game-modes are completely removed. In addition, only 6 out of the 15 race courses in the original game are playable in Arcade, and all Arena maps are also removed.

## Why is this important?
Initally, it was thought impossible to restore the features missing from Arcade, as it was assumed that all of it had been either mutilated or stripped out of the game entirely. This, interestingly enough, was false.
  The version of Arcade we have today (1.42 CEC) happens to be a development build of the game, meaning that despite the code going overall unused, unless it was modified, everything (Minus some major asset files, I'll get back to that later) is still there.
  Itsmeft24 created Pentane, and then created the plugin ArcadeEssentials which re-enables the majority of disabled features and fixes several issues caused by Raw Thrills' modifications. This effectively transformed Arcade into something very close to a development build of Win32, meaning a version of Cars 2: The Video Game equivalent to the Xbox 360 version of the game, except running natively on PC.
  Despite this, the missing maps and track assets remained a major barrier. To address this, itsmeft24 partnered with another modder, MythicalBry to create Cars 2: Restorations, a project focused on endian-swapping the missing assets from Xbox 360 into a format compatible with Arcade. This filled in the last major gaps and brought the game closer than ever to a fully restored experience.

## Where does this leave us now?
After quite a few years of Win32_Wii being the primary platform of Cars 2 to mod, ArcadeEssentials and Cars 2: Restorations have made Arcade the primary version of the game to mod. Win32_Wii is for the most part considered the legacy modding platform.
