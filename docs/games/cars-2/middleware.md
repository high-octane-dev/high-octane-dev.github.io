# Middleware software used in Cars 2 The Video Game

## Scaleform GFx 3.3.91
Autodesk Scaleform GFx is used to render the user interface using  `.swf` files that are contained within `/assets/flash/flash.zip`. JPEX Free Flash Decompiler can be used to view and edit the existing `.swf` in the game. Adding more requires modifying the game via a Pentane plugin.

## FMOD Designer Ver. 4.32.8
`To be added`

## Annosoft Lipsync SDK / "The Lipsync Tool!"
`To be added`

## Bink Video Ver. 1.9.99.0 / RAD Video Tools
Bink Video is used for playing back videos in the game such as `opening.bik`, and is included in with the game as `binkw32.dll`. RAD Video Tools is used to convert `.bik` files to formats such as `.mp4` and back. Although the exact version that was used by Avalanche is unknown, any version of RAD Video Tools will work for creating videos compatible with the game, so long as it's in the Bink 1 format.
