# Arcade (Win32) vs PC (Win32Wii)

## What is Arcade / Win32?
Disney Pixar's Cars Arcade - referred to here simply as Arcade - is a heavily modified development build of the Xbox 360-equivalent PC version of Cars 2: The Video Game internally known as Win32. The modified version was created by Raw Thrills to function as a simplified, generic kart racer for arcade venues like Chuck E. Cheese, it features streamlined gameplay and only a single mode (Race) and only 6 out of the 15 tracks while also lacking all of the Arena maps.

## What is PC / Win32Wii
The official PC port of Cars 2: The Video Game on the other hand was a STRIPPED DOWN port of the version produced for the Wii. As a result of this, Win32Wii features heavily downgraded visuals compared to Arcade, but unlike Arcade, retains all gameplay modes.

## Why is this important?
Initally, it was thought impossible to restore the features missing from Arcade, as it was assumed that all of it had been either mutilated or hardcoded out of the game entirely. This, interestingly enough, was false. 
  The version of Arcade we have today (1.42 CEC) happens to be a development build of the game, meaning that despite the code going overall unused, unless it was modified, everything (Minus some major asset files, I'll get back to that later) is still there.
  Itsmeft24 created Pentane, and then created the plugin ArcadeEssentials which re-enables the majority of disabled features and fixes several issues caused by Raw Thrills' modifications. This effectively transformed Arcade into something very close to a development build of Win32, meaning a version of Cars 2: The Video Game equivalent to the Xbox 360 version of the game, except running natively on PC.
  Despite this, the missing maps and track assets remained a major barrier. To address this, itsmeft24 partnered with another modder, MythicalBry to create Cars 2: Restorations, a project focused on endian-swapping the missing assets from Xbox 360 into a format compatible with Arcade. This filled in the last major gaps and brought the game closer than ever to a fully restored experience.

## Where does this leave us now?
After quite a few years of Win32Wii being the primary platform of Cars 2 to mod, ArcadeEssentials and Cars 2: Restorations have made Arcade the primary version of the game to mod. Win32Wii is for the most part considered the legacy modding platform.
