## Welcome to Cars: Mater-National Modding!

This site serves as a central database for all things Cars: Mater-National modding; from documentation of the game's C++ classes to tutorials on how to make custom animations!

As this site is currently under construction, most pages are empty, and significant amount of information is missing. If you're looking to help add new pages or revise existing ones, feel free to contribute via PR!
