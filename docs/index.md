## What is Pentane?

Pentane is a user-configurable plugin loader and modding framework for the following games:

- Rhythm Racing Engine
	- Cars: The Video Game (PC) üü® *Experimental!*
	- Cars: Mater-National Championship (PC) üü® *Experimental!*
- Octane Engine
	- Cars 2: The Video Game (PC) ‚úÖ *Production-Ready!*
	- Cars 2: Arcade (PC) ‚úÖ *Production-Ready!*
	- Cars 3: Driven to Win (Xbox One) ‚ùå *Non-Functional!*

Pentane's plugin system allows plugin developers to **modify game code**, and implement new functionalities/bug fixes directly into games.
These plugins are developed from collective reverse-engineering efforts, and utilize strategies such as **function hooking** to intercept/replace individual functions or parts of functions with custom implementations.
